## Jupyter notebooks

Most of the events use a notebook to go through example code. We will mainly use Watson Studio to run these, but you can run them on any platform. To follow along in Watson Studio sign up for a [free IBM Cloud account](https://ibm.biz/BdqQ4s) and create a Watson Studio service as described in [these instructions](https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/data-science-lunch-and-learn/blob/master/watson-studio-instructions.md). Use the below urls to load the notebook for each of the events to follow along during the event.

#### Call for Code Spot Challenge for Wildfires

The ultimate goal of this challenge is to predict the area of wildfires in 7 regions in Australia for February 2021 with historical wildfire and both historical and forecast weather data, so you will be predicting fires before they happened!
The final submissions will be on **31 January 2021**.
