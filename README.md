# Every Monday: Data Science Lunch & Learn

Online at lunch time on [Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io/ibmdevelopereurope)

* [Past events](#Past)
* [More events and resources](#resources)

Many of the events use a **Jupyter notebook** to go through example code. We will mainly use Watson Studio to run these, but you can run them on any platform. To follow along in Watson Studio sign up for a [free IBM Cloud account](https://ibm.biz/BdfBr6) and create a Watson Studio service as described in [these instructions](https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/data-science-lunch-and-learn/blob/master/watson-studio-instructions.md).

## Upcoming events

### You?
* We are busy planning new events and creating new content and material. **Suggestions on topics and speakers are always welcome! Let us know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/Data-Science-Lunch-and-Learn/issues) in this repo**

### Coming soon
* [Call for Code Wildfires Challenge](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Spot-Challenge-Wildfires) - hear from the teams how they they build their model to predict wildfires
* Trusted AI - learn about fairness and explainability 
* Data exploration with Python - series using various datasets 
* Deep learning series

## More events and resources

#### Call for Code Spot Challenge for Wildfires

The ultimate goal of this challenge is to predict the area of wildfires in 7 regions in Australia for February 2021 with historical wildfire and both historical and forecast weather data, so you will be predicting fires before they happened!
The final submissions were on **31 January 2021**.
